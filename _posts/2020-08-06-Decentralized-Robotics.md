I am currently helping Prof. Lina Li in building and testing multi-agent algorithms. We are working with Turtlebot3 robots, programmed using ROS to implement and simulate online tracking algorithms. As a part of this project, I learned and presented on SLAM algorithms used on the Turtlebot3 platform.
â€‹
I also independently worked on a novel multi-robot search algorithm based on zeroth-order gradient descent methods.

Earlier this year I implemented LQR and PID controllers for a m3pi robot following a circular trajectory. A vision-tracking system provided the location data of the robot, and several MATLAB scripts implemented the controller itself. See my Github for some of my research projects.

Prof. Lina Li

Funded by the Harvard PRISE Fellowship, I am currently leading an undergraduate team in building a multi-robot algorithms testbed for Prof. Lina Li of the EE department at Harvard.

​

We are working with Turtlebot3 robots, programmed using ROS to implement and simulate online tracking algorithms. As a part of this project, I learned and presented on SLAM algorithms used on the Turtlebot3 platform.

​

I am also independently designing a novel multi-robot search algorithm based on zeroth-order gradient descent methods.


Earlier this year I implemented LQR and PID controllers for a m3pi robot following a circular trajectory. A vision-tracking system provided the location data of the robot, and several MATLAB scripts implemented the controller itself. See my Github for some of my research projects.

Skills: ROS/C++, MATLAB, Optimization, Reinforcment Learning, Classical Controls

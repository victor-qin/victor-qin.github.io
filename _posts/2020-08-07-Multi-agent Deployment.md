For my ES 159: Introduction to Robotics class, I wanted to look at a SLAM algorithm that would explore a space while also maintaining observational capabilities in that space - what is termed the deployment problem. I found a paper by Kantaros et al., which addressed a known version of the problem.

​
With help from Yiannis Kantaros at UPenn, I was able to replicate their results, as well as demonstrating feasibility in unknown environments. In addition, I added patrol behavior by using time-varying density functions to modify robot motion, which has interesting theoretical and practical considerations.

​

I hope to continue thinking and studying this problem in the future. You can check out my final report here.

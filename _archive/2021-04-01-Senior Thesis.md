description: Senior undergraduate thesis on using federated learning to learn model free controllers
---

My senior undergraduate thesis studied using federated reinforcement learning methods to accelerate the training of model free low-level controllers. This was done by letting multiple agents train on the RL enironment while periodically averaging network weights from each agent, which led to shared information and faster training. 

The thesis was award High Honors in the Electrical Engineering department.

Skills: Python, Tensorflow, Machine Learning

description: Organizing a virtual hackathon with 6 Ivy Leagues
---
Hackathons in the post-COVID era will have to change - putting hundreds of college students in a building, then shipping them back home 2 days later is recipe for virus spread. Virtual hackathons will have very little differentiation for the forseeable future, run with limited resources and attention.

Instead of running a virtual version of the usual hackathon, students from 6 Ivy League schools have combined forces to make *IvyHacks 2020!* We're using this opportunity to redefine hackathons and create the best virtual hacking experience we can internationally. Personally, working with and leading the sponsorships team has been a fantastic experience learning how other schools operate and seeing this project grow!

Check us out <a href="https://www.ivyhacks.com">here</a>, and attend IvyHacks 2020 from Oct. 1-4!

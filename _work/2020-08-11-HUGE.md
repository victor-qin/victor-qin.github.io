description: 50-pages of undergraduate advice on Harvard Engineering
---
Harvard engineering generally has a lot of requirements, and navigating it as a first-year is pretty difficult. I worte the Havard Undergraduate Guide to Engineering with my Mentorship co-chairs as a comprehensive guide about all things engineering at Harvard from the student view - picking courses, getting good study habits, even advice for finding internships. It came out to 50 pages of condensed information from the Harvard engineering community, and it received great reviews from freshmen in its first year last year.
